Bob wanted to write a poem
As long as long can be,
To break the world record
For length of poetry.
He built sentences all day
And dreamt of words at night,
For the most fantastic poem
Bob did long to write.
And he'd tell to all his friends
The words he'd made that day,
"What a clever chap is Bob,"
Those friends were bound to say.
He wrote of far off lands
And sailors lost at sea,
The people all would cry,
"Tell us again how it can be!"
But he never once went back
Chosing instead to write more,
A million different adventures
Just outside the door.
He described love and hate,
Rebellion, peace and war,
It was the kind of poem
You'd think would never bore.
It had darkness, it had light
And dreams beyond compare,
The poem was Bob's soul,
His hope and his despair.
But the other poets mocked him,
Cursed his meter and his rhyme,
"You make mockery of poetry
And your diction is a crime."
So Bob hid himself away
No longer seeking fortune or fame,
But he continued with his poem
Told to anyone who came.
The children flocked for miles
Just to hear the words Bob wrote,
He came higher than J.K. Rowling
In their favourite authors vote.
The adults often called in too
Though his words soon lost their appeal,
Life has more exciting things than poetry
So they searched for experiences more real.
Bob's visitors slowly trailled away
Until he was almost on his own,
But he was still determined
To finish the world's longest poem.
Does such a quest ever have an end?
Well it came the day Bob died,
For seventy long years
That poem had been his pride.
At one hundred and one years old
He had finally passed away
And a whisper swept the town,
"Now we'll see what the record books say.
For the world's longest poem
Must be worth quite a price,
I wonder if they'll pay us
For even just a slice."
The people all assembled
And searched right through his home,
But they found only blank notebooks
Not a single little poem.
And it took a simple child
To tell them all the truth,
That Bob had been illiterate
Since the days of his youth.
He painted poetry with words
But in pen he could not write,
So the record books would never
Hold Bob's name in plain sight.
Although some could remember pieces
The poem was now lost,
And everyone started crying
For they now could count the cost.
They put off for tomorrow
What could have been done today,
But the story had now ended
When poor Bob passed away.
His name would be forgotten
For he could not write it down,
It was a complete disaster
That upset all the town.
Not one of them could continue
The world's longest piece of poetry,
So they simply started another
To tell of Bob to everybody.
This, their poem tells his story
So all can know of his plight,
And of how poetry gave him wings
So to heaven he could take flight.
